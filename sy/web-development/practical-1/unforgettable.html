      <p>
        I passed my 12th in first class and stepped into a new world of college
        life. This was quite energetic that I was to mingle with different
        people with different nature. It taught me to be more cautious and how
        to judge a person. In these four years of college life, we went for a
        trip to Kodaikanal for the first time. That day became more important as
        our first semester results were published by that day evening. In the
        third year we went for a trip for 3 days to Cochin, Trivandrum and
        Munnar. We enjoyed a lot and also learnt about ISRO.
