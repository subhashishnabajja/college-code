# Problem Statement

The shortest job first algorithm is a CPU scheduling algorithm that selects the job with the shortest CPU burst time and allocates that process to the CPU.

## Algorithm (Revision 1)

1. Start
2. Initialize data structures
3. Procedure
4. End

## Algorithm (Revision 2)

1. Start
2. Initialize an list `processes = []` to store all the processes.
3. Select a process for the `processes` list which has the shortest burst time and execute that process.
4. Repeat Step(3) until the `processes` list is empty.
5. End
